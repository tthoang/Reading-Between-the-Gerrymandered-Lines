## Summary:
This project is the capstone project for my Data Analytics course at the Nashville Software School which occurred from September 2020 to January 2021. This project is intended to be an interactive dashboard to help constituents understand how the value of their vote is weighted in their congressional district. The user will be able to filter by demographic factors such as age group, race, education attainment, and sex to see which factors give constituents less or more value in their vote. 

## Background:
As a former political field campaign consultant, I worked on various congressional races in various states where I consistently heard the phrase “Well, my vote doesn’t even matter”.  After gaining the skills through Nashville Software School, I wanted to create an interactive tool to show the true value of a constituent’s vote within their district. 

## Motivation:
My capstone project focuses on US Congressional Districts and how those districts are drawn means for voters and what their vote is worth in context of the district that they are registered in. 

My passion for this project stems from my prior experience working on political field campaigns in various states as well as my enthusiasm for civic education and civic duty. Congressional district mapping and the US census are re-evaluated and re-drawn decennially meaning after 2020, our congressional map will be evolving again. 

Whether or not people believe the US Census or congressional design is important to them personally, it does not change the impact that trickles down to our everyday lives- via the value of a vote in one state versus another or who their elected officials are- can be dependent on how these states’ districts are outlined. Voters choose their representatives but every ten years, elected representatives have the opportunity to choose their voters.

## Goal:
Using demographic data (specifically age, race, education attainment, and sex) and geospatial data to create a dashboard to help people see the weighted value of their vote in their congressional district.
